<h1>What is Microprocessor?</h1>
<p>A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) which incorporates core functions of a computer’s central
 processing unit (CPU).
 It is a programmable multipurpose silicon chip, clock driven, register based, accepts binary data as
 input and provides output after processing it as per the instructions stored in the memory.</p>

<h1>Why we need a Microprocessor?</h1>
<p>A microprocessor is similar to our human brain, it can be trained to do anything. 
It can be programmed to do anything we want based on it’s instruction set and capabilities. 
Sometimes solutions are very complex, circuits also becomes very complex if we try to solve it without programming.
Here is my analogy. Imagine you want to make a big building. Usage of BRICKS will make the construction process simple and cost effective.
 And it will also give you the freedom to make the building in shape and size what you like.
 Instruction set in a microprocessor are the bricks which you can use to solve your problem.
 By using those instructions you can easily solve complex program.</p>
<h1>How does Microprocessor work?</h1>
<p>A processor is the brain of a computer which basically consists of Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU), Control Unit and Register Array. 
As the name indicates ALU performs all arithmetic and logical operations on the data received from input devices or memory. 
Register array consists of a series of registers like accumulator (A), B, C, D etc. which acts as temporary fast access memory locations for processing data. 
As the name indicates, control unit controls the flow of instructions and data throughout the system.
So basically a microprocessor takes input from input devices, process it as per instructions given in the memory and produces output.</P>

<h1>Advantages of Microprocessor</h1>
<ul>
<li><h4>Low caste</h4><p>Microprocessors are available at low cost due to integrated circuit technology. Which will reduce the cost of a computer system.</p></li>
<li><h4>High speed</h4><p>Microprocessor chips can work at very high speed due to the technology involved in it. It is capable of executing millions of instructions per second.</p></li>
<li><h4>Versatile</h4><p>Microprocessors are very versatile, the same chip can be used for a number of applications by simply changing the program (instructions stored in the memory).</p></li>
<li><h4>Low Power Consumption</h4><p>microprocessors are usually manufactured using metal oxide semiconductor technology, in which MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) are working in saturation and cut off modes. 
So the power consumption is very low compared to others.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>CLASSIFICATION OF MICROPROCESSOR </h2>
<h4>RISC – Reduced Instruction Set Computer</h4>
<p>RISC is a type of microprocessor architecture which uses small, general purpose and highly optimized instruction set rather than more specialized set of instructions found in others.
 RISC offers high performance over its opposing architecture CISC (see below). 
In a processor, execution of each instruction require a special circuit to load and process the data. 
So by reducing instructions, the processor will be using simple circuits and faster in operation.</P>
<ol>
<li>Simple instruction set</li>
<li>Larger program</li>
<li>Consists of large number of registers</li>
<li>Simple processor circuitry (small number of transistors)</li>
<li>More RAM usage</li>
<li>Fixed length instructions</li>
<li>Simple addressing modes</li>
<li>Usually fixed number of clock cycles for executing one instruction</li>
</ol>
<h4>CISC – Complex Instruction Set Computer</h4>
<p>CISC is the opposing microprocessor architecture for RISC. It is made to reduce the number of instructions per program, ignoring the number of cycles per instruction.
 So complex instructions are directly made into hardware making the processor complex and slower in operation.

This architecture is actually designed to reduce the cost of memory by reducing the program length.</p>
<ol>
<li>Complex instruction set</li>
<li>Smaller program</li>
<li>Less number of registers</li>
<li>Complex processor circuitry (more number of transistors)</li>
<li>Little RAM usage</li>
<li>Variable length instructions</li>
<li>Variety of addressing modes</li>
<li>Variable number of clock cycles for each instructions</li>
</ol>

<h4>Special Purpose Processors</h4>
<p>There are some processors which are designed to handle some specific functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>DSP – Digital Signal Processors</li>
<li>Coprocessors – processors used along with a main processor (8087 math-coprocessor used with 8086)</li>
<li>Input/Output processors</li>
<li>Transputer – Transistor Computer : Microprocessor with its own local memory</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Intel 4004 – The First Microprocessor</li>
<li>Intel 8085</li>
<li>Intel 8086</li>
<li>Intel Pentium 4</li>
<li>Intel Core i7</li>
<li>AMD Athlon</li>
</ol>

<h1>What is Microcontroller</h1>
<p>A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self-contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system.
 A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies</p>
<p>Microcontrollers usually must have low-power requirements since many devices they control are battery-operated.
 Microcontrollers are used in many consumer electronics, car engines, computer peripherals and test or measurement equipment. 
And these are well suited for long lasting battery applications. 
The dominant part of microcontrollers being used now a days are implanted in other apparatus.</p>
<h2> How Microcontroller are classified </h2>
<p>The microcontrollers are characterized regarding bus-width, instruction set, and memory structure. 
For the same family, there may be different forms with different sources. 
This article is going to describe some of the basic types of the Microcontroller that newer users may not know about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification According to Number of Bits</li>
<li>Classification According to Memory Devices</li>
<li>Classification According to Memory Architecture</li>
<li>Classification According to Instruction Set</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application of microcontroller</h2>
<p>Microcontroller has many applications electronic equipment’s</p>
